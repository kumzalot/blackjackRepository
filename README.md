Still figuring out how github works, this readme says "this is the repo for uploading all the code files required for the blackjack game project. 
This initial version of the game will be text-based and features one player and one dealer.
Future improvements could include adding multiplayer(online),graphics implementations,setting this up in a website,etc.
